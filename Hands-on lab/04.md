## Exercise 4: Securing the network

Duration: 45 minutes

Synopsis: In this exercise, attendees will utilize Network Security Groups to ensure that virtual machines are segregated from other Azure hosted services and then explore the usage of the Network Packet Capture feature of Azure to actively monitor traffic between networks.

### Task 1: Test network security group rules \#1

1. In the Azure Portal, select **Virtual Machines**.

2. Select **paw-1**, then select **Connect**.  

3. In the dialog, select **Download RDP file Anyway**.  Open the downloaded RDP file and connect to the Virtual Machine.

    > **Note**: Default username is **wsadmin** with **p!ssword1rocks** as password and you may need to request JIT Access if you have taken a break between exercises.

4. In the **PAW-1** virtual machine, open **Windows PowerShell ISE** as **administrator**.

    - Select the **Windows** icon.

    - Right-click **Windows PowerShell ISE**, choose **More**, then select **Run as Administrator**.

5. Copy and run the following command:

    ```PowerShell
    Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
    ```

    ![The PowerShell ISE window displays the execution policy change command.](media/2020-01-12-12-39-24.png "PowerShell")

6. In the dialog, select **Yes**.

7. Select **File-\>Open**, browse to the extracted GitHub directory and open the **C:\MCW-Security-baseline-on-Azure\Hands-on lab\Scripts\\PortScanner.ps1**.

    > **Note**: You would have downloaded the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Microsoft/MCW-Azure-Security-Privacy-and-Compliance) and extracted this in the setup steps.  If you did not perform those steps, perform them now. You can also choose to copy the file from your desktop to the VM.

8. Review the script. Notice that it does the following:

    - Installs NotePad++

    - Adds hosts entries for DNS

    > **Note**: When using multiple virtual networks, you must setup a DNS server in the Azure tenant.

    - Executes port scans

9. Press **F5** to run the script. You should see the following (the Azure ARM Template created a default rule to block all traffic):

    - Port scan for port 3389 (RDP) to **DB-1** and **WEB-1** is unsuccessful from the **PAW-1** machine.

    - The information above for port 3389 (RDP) is visible after running the script and pressing **F5**.

    ![The information above for port 3389 (RDP) is visible after running the script and pressing F5.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Azuresecurityprivacyandcomplianceimages/media/image55.png)

    - Port scan for port 1433 (SQL) to **DB-1** and **WEB-1** is unsuccessful from the **PAW-1** machine. **DB-1** is running SQL Server but traffic is blocked at NSG and via the Windows Firewall.

    ![The information above for port 1433 (SQL) is visible after running the script and pressing F5.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Azuresecurityprivacyandcomplianceimages/media/image56.png "View the information")

    - Port scan for port 80 (HTTP) to **DB-1** and **WEB-1** is unsuccessful from the **PAW-1** machine, if traffic was allowed, it would always fail to **DB-1** because it is not running IIS or any other web server.

    ![The information above for port 80 (HTTP) is visible after running the script and pressing F5.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Azuresecurityprivacyandcomplianceimages/media/image57.png)

> **Note**:  The ARM template deploys a Deny All rule.  If you were to simply create a Network Security Group from the UI, you would not experience this behavior.

### Task 2: Configure network security groups

1. Switch to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. Configure the database server to only allow SQL Connections from the web server:

    - Select **Network Security Groups**.

    - Select **DbTrafficOnly**.

    - Select **Inbound Security Rules**.

    - Select **+Add**.

    - For the **Source**, select **IP Addresses**.

    - For the **Source IP address**, enter **10.2.0.4**.
  
    - For the **Destination**, keep **Any**.

    - For the **Destination port range**, enter **1433**.

    - For the **Priority**, enter **100**.

    - For the **Name**, enter **Port_1433**.

    - Select **Add**.

3. Configure the web server to allow all HTTP and HTTPS connections:

    - Select **Network Security Groups**.

    - Select **WebTrafficOnly**.

    - Select **Inbound Security Rules**.

    - Select **+Add**.

    - For the **Source**, keep **Any**.

    - For the **Destination**, keep **Any**.

    - For the **Destination port ranges**, enter **80,443**.

    - For the **Priority**, enter **100**.

    - Change the **Name** to **Port\_80\_443**.

    - Select **Add**.

    > **Note**: In some rare cases it may take up to 15 minutes for your Network Security Group to change its status from **Updating**.  You won't be able to add any other rules until it completes.

4. Configure both the database and web server to only allow RDP connections from the PAW machine:

    - Select **Network Security Groups.** For both the **DbTrafficOnly** and **WebTrafficOnly**, do the following:

       - Select **Inbound Security Rules**.

       - Select **+Add**.

       - For the **Source**, select **IP Addresses**.

       - For the **Source IP address**, enter **10.0.0.4**.

       - For the **Destination port range**, enter **3389**.

       - For the **Priority**, enter **101**.

       - For the **Name**, enter **Port_3389**.

       - Select **Add**.

5. Configure all Network Security Groups to have Diagnostic logs enabled.

    - Select **Network security groups.** For each NSG (DBTrafficOnly and WebTrafficOnly), do the following:

       - In the content menu, select **Diagnostic logs**, and then select **Add diagnostic setting**.

        ![Diagnostics settings is selected under Monitoring on the left side, and Add diagnostics settings is selected on the right.](media/2019-12-19-18-53-52.png "Add diagnostic settings")

      - For the name, enter the NSG name and then add **Logging** to the end.

      - Check the **Send to Log Analytics** checkbox, in the **Log Analytics** box, select **Configure**.

      - Select the **azseclog...** workspace.

      - Select both LOG checkboxes.

      - Select **Save**.

       ![Save is highlighted at the top, and two log items are selected below.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Azuresecurityprivacyandcomplianceimages/media/image122.png "Save the logs")

       - Repeat for all remaining Network Security Groups.

### Task 3: Test network security group rules \#2

1. Switch back to the **PAW-1** virtual machine.

2. Press **F5** to run the **PortScan** script. You should see the following:

    - Port scan for port 3389 (RDP) to **DB-1** and **WEB-1** is successful from the **PAW-1** machine.

    ![The information above for port 3389 (RDP) is visible after running the script and pressing F5.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Azuresecurityprivacyandcomplianceimages/media/image61.png "View the information")

    - Port scan for port 1433 (SQL) to **DB-1** is successful, and **WEB-1** is unsuccessful from the **PAW-1** machine.
    
    > **Note**: You may need to disable the windows firewall on the DB-1 server to achieve this result.

    ![The information above for port 1433 (SQL) is visible after running the script and pressing F5.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Azuresecurityprivacyandcomplianceimages/media/image62.png "View the information")

    - If IIS has been setup on WEB-1, the port scan for port 80 (HTTP) to **DB-1** is unsuccessful and **WEB-1** is successful from the **PAW-1** machine

    ![The information above for port 80 (HTTP) is visible after running the script and pressing F5.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Azuresecurityprivacyandcomplianceimages/media/image63.png "View the information")

### Task 4: Install network watcher VM extension

3. Expand the subscription regions item you are running your labs in.

4. For the **East US** region (or whatever region you deployed your VMs too), select the ellipsis, then select **Enable Network Watcher**.

    ![The East US row is highlighted under Region, and Enable network watcher is selected in the submenu.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Azuresecurityprivacyandcomplianceimages/media/image68.png "Enable Network Watcher")

5. In the new context menu, select **Packet capture**.

6. Select **+Add**.

    ![Packet capture is selected and highlighted on the left under Network Diagnostic Tools, and + Add is highlighted at the top right.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Azuresecurityprivacyandcomplianceimages/media/image69.png "Add a packet capture")

7. Select your subscription.

8. Select your resource group.

9. For the target virtual machine, ensure that **db-1** is selected.

10. For the capture name, enter **databasetraffic**.

11. Notice the ability to save the capture file to the local machine or an Azure storage account. Ensure that the resource group storage account is selected.  If you check your resource group, the storage account is prefixed with **"diagstor"**.

    ![In the Add packet capture window, databasetraffic is entered in the Packet capture name box, and the Storage account check box is checked.](media/2020-01-12-12-24-05.png "Dialog box screenshot")

12. For the values, enter the following:

    - Maximum bytes per packet: 0.
    - Maximum bytes per session: 1073741824.
    - Time limit: 600.

13. Select **OK**.

### Task 6: Execute a port scan

1. Switch your Remote Desktop connection to the **PAW-1** virtual machine.

2. Uncomment the last line of the script, and press **F5**.

   ![The PowerShell ISE window displays uncommented PowerShell script port scan command.](media/2020-01-12-12-49-13.png "Running the uncommented PowerShell script")

    > **Note**: You should see the basic ports scanned, and then a port scan from 80 to 443. This will generate many security center logs for the Network Security Group which will be used in the Custom Alert in the next exercise.
