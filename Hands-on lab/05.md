## Exercise 5: Azure Sentinel Logging and Reporting

Duration: 20 minutes

Synopsis: In this exercise, you will setup Azure Sentinel to point to a logging workspace and then create custom alerts that execute Azure Runbooks.

### Task 1: Create a dashboard

1. Open the Azure Portal.

2. Select **All services**, then type **Sentinel**, select **Azure Sentinel**.

    ![All Services is selected in the left menu, and a search for Sentinel is displayed along with its search results.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Azuresecurityprivacyandcomplianceimages/media/image94.png "Searching for Sentinel")

3. In the blade, select **+Add**, select the **Log Analytics** resource for your resource group, then choose **Add Azure Sentinel**.

   ![The screenshot displays the Azure workspace found in the resource group.](media/2020-01-12-12-54-25.png "Azure Workspace")

4. In the blade, under **Threat Management**, select **Workbooks**.

5. In the list of workbooks, select **Azure Network Watcher**, choose **Save**.

6. Select the region and choose **OK**.

7. In the list of workbooks, select **Azure AD Audit logs**, select **Save**.

8. Select the region and select **OK**.

    ![In the left menu beneath Threat Management the Workbooks item is selected and the Azure AD Audit Logs item is selected beneath the Templates tab on the right.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Azuresecurityprivacyandcomplianceimages/media/image95.png "Adding a workbook")

9. Select **View saved workbook**, take a moment to review your new workbook.

    > **Note**: You may not have data in the log analytics workspace.  Wait for 10-15 minutes.

### Task 2: Create an Analytics alert

1. Navigate back to the **Azure Sentinel** workspace, in the **Configuration** blade section, select **Analytics** then select **+Create** then **Scheduled query rule**.

    ![In the left menu beneath Configuration the Analytics item is selected. To the right, the + Create button is expanded and the Scheduled query rule item is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Azuresecurityprivacyandcomplianceimages/media/image96.png "Adding a analytics alert")

2. On the **General** tab, enter **PortScans** for the name.

3. For the description, enter **A custom rule to detect port scans**, select **Next: Set rule logic**.

4. In the **Rule query** text box, type:

    ```PowerShell
    AzureDiagnostics
    | where ruleName_s == 'UserRule_DenyAll' and Type != 'AzureMetric' and type_s == 'block' and direction_s == 'In' and Resource == 'WEBTRAFFICONLY' and OperationName == 'NetworkSecurityGroupCounters'
    | summarize AggregatedValue = sum(matchedConnections_d) by ruleName_s, primaryIPv4Address_s
    | where AggregatedValue > 0
    ```

    ![In this screenshot, the alert simulation shows data after the query has been entered.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Azuresecurityprivacyandcomplianceimages/media/image97.png "Reviewing alert simulation data")

    > **Note**: If you were quick going through the labs, then you may not have log data in the Log Analytics workspace just yet that corresponds to "AzureMetric". You may need to wait 15-30 minutes before a query will execute.

    > **Note**: Since the introduction of Azure Security Center and Sentinel, the backend logging has changed a few times as well as the way the calculations are done in the rule query (timespan in query vs outside query, etc.). The ultimate goal of this query is to find when a series of failed connection attempts have been made against a network security group and a specific deny rule. If for some reason the UI/backend has been modified since the last published lab, modify the query to accomplish this goal.

5. Under **Map entities**, for the **IP**, select the **primaryIPv4Address_s** column.

6. Under **Query scheduling**, for the **Run query every** setting, type **5** minutes.

    >**Note**:  This is a lab and you want to see the results as quickly as possible. In a production environment, you may want to choose a different time threshold.

7. For the **Lookup data from the last**, type **1** hours.

8. Under **Alert threshold**, for the **Generate alert when number of query results**, enter **1**.

    > **Note:** We want to hit the threshold quickly for lab purposes. This query and value may not be appropriate for production and is only for learning purposes.

    Review the current data to determine what would trigger the alert.  Notice the red threshold line intersects the blue event data line.

    ![A chart is displayed showing the current log data and the alert threshold. The red and blue line intersect in the chart.](media/2020-01-12-13-26-17.png "Results Preview")

9. Select **Next: Automated response**, notice you have no playbooks to select yet.

10. Select **Next: Review**.

11. Select **Create**.

    > **Note**:  It may take a few minutes for the alert to fire.  You may need to run the PortScan script a few times from **paw-1**

    ![In the Azure Sentinel Analytics screen beneath the Active Rules tab, the PortScans rule is highlighted in the table and its status shows it is Enabled.](media/2020-01-12-13-03-56.png "PortScan configured")

### Task 3: Investigate a custom alert incident

1. In the main menu, select **Azure Sentinel**.

2. Select **Incidents**.

3. Select the new **PortScans** incident.

    ![In the Azure Sentinel Incidents window, the most recent PortScans security alert is selected from the table.](media/2020-01-12-13-30-12.png "View the new PortScans alert")

    > **Note**: It may take 15-20 minutes for the alert to fire. You can continue to execute the port scan script to cause log events or you can lower the threshold for the custom alert.

4. In the dialog, choose **Investigate**.

    ![The incident dialog is displayed with the Investigate button selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Azuresecurityprivacyandcomplianceimages/media/image76.png "Investigate an incident")

5. In future versions, you will get to see insights about the alerts and the resources related to what caused it to fire:
